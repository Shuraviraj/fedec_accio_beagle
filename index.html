            <h1>The Beagle Blog</h1>
            <p>The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle
                was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. Possessing a great sense of smell and
                superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited
                agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent and is a
                popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.</p>
